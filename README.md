# MLCourseProject

Repository for Course Project for Practical Machine Learning on Coursera

Brief directory desctiptions:

- *courseProject.Rmd* - R Markdown file of the project. Current directory should be set to this file directory before running
- *courseProject.html* - compiled *courseProject.Rmd*
- *pml-training.csv* - training data; *courseProject.Rmd* will attempt to load the data from web anyway. However, commenting out download line in *courseProject.Rmd* and using file *pml-training.csv* from local directory makes compiling drafts much faster.
- *pml-testing.csv* - test data. Not used for *courseProject.Rmd*.
- *MLCourseProject.Rproj* - RStudio project file
